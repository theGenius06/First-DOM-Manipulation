# Landing Page Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive landing page where navigation dynamically adjusts to the content of the page. It uses JavaScript to enhance functionality, allowing smooth scrolling, dynamic navigation updates, and responsive design. Users can interact with the navigation bar, scroll smoothly to sections, and see active states for both sections and navigation items. A "Back to Top" button is displayed when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, enabling a quick return to the top.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation links are generated dynamically based on the sections present in the HTML.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: The section in the viewport is highlighted, along with its corresponding navigation item.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking a navigation item or the "Back to Top" button smoothly scrolls to the respective section.
- **"Back to Top" Button**: A button appears when the user scrolls to the bottom, allowing a quick return to the top of the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
